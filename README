Project Title: Online IDE "ExeCode"

==============================================
Abstract:
This project is being developed by taking into consideration the developers working in a team who have to frequently install and upgrade software. The aim is to provide an online repository for storing their code and to carry out tasks such as compilation, debugging and execution at server-side. This will help the developers to view, edit, compile, debug and execute their code anytime anywhere even if they are working in a team. Also we have integrated our project with Github for Version Controlling so that projects that are saved on the Github account gets downloaded on our server and the user can perform the above mentioned tasks on those repositories as well. The modifications that are made on these repositories are pushed back to the Github server.

Client-side

Needs Google Chrome 13 (or higher version) or Safari as web sockets are not supported by other browsers.

The work is still in progress. So many validations are yet to be done.
1. Hence you need to create a new project before creating a new file.
2. You will see the experts option and the chat option. These are not yet implemented. 

(We are providing chat service so no need to open any other application if you have doubts and want to chat with your friends who is in your circle.
Experts Algorithm - Basically a forum is provided in which the user can put any number of question. Any one is free to reply to the questions being asked.
